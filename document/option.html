<h1>Options</h1>

<h2><a name="option">Activate Optional Features</a></h2>

<p> Some optional features in CoH can be activated by
the <code>option</code> lines in the <code>DATA</code> section,
followed by an option keyword. There is no parameters.  The option
keyword just turns on the special functionality that is not so common
in a standard calculations. </p>

<p>This option capability could be used for an ad-hoc change to the
code. It does not guarantee the provided options work in a same way
for a newer versions of CoH.</p>


<h2><a name="internalconversion">Internal Conversion</a></h2>

<pre>
DATA     :
option   : internalconversion
ENDDATA  :
</pre>

<p>This option applies the internal conversion (IC) coefficients to
the produced gamma-rays when printing. The IC coefficients are taken
from RIPL. This option is used to compare experimental data of photon
production, if they are not corrected by IC. </p>


<h2><a name="ewtransformation">Engelbrecht-Weidenmueller transformation</a></h2>

<pre>
option   : ewtransformation
</pre>

<p>Perform Engelbrecht-Weidenmueller transformation for the coupled-channels
S-matrix to calculate compound inelastic scattering cross section. This option
is important when the target deformation is large and the incident energy is low.
The effect of this option will be very small above 1 MeV or so.</p>


<h2><a name="readphotoabsorption">Photon strength function from external file</a></h2>

<pre>
option   : readphotoabsorption
</pre>

<p>Replace gamma-ray strength functions that are calculated internally by 
data given by an external file. This replacement is performed only for the first
compound nucleus, while all the other nuclei emerging in the decay chain use
the internal GDR parameters. The external data are given as the photo-absorption
cross sections for different gamma-ray multipolarites in the table format like</p>

#   Eg[MeV]       E1[mb]       M1[mb]       E2[mb]       M2[mb]       E3[mb]
     0.0200  2.23005e-03  1.84388e-06  1.79236e-06  1.47510e-09  1.43389e-09
     0.0400  4.45469e-03  7.37580e-06  7.16958e-06  5.90064e-09  5.73567e-09

</pre>
<p>where the multipolarities are given in the order of E1, M1, E2, M2, ...
The highest multipolarity is arbitrary. If only E1 is given, CoH applies 
the internal GDRs for the higher multipolarities. </p>

<p>Currently the data file name is
fixed, <code>CoHPhotoabsorption.dat</code>, and it must be in the
current directory.</p>


<h2><a name="readdensity">Level density from external file</a></h2>

<pre>
option   : readdensity
</pre>

<p>Read tabulated pre-calculated level densities from an external
file. The data file should be in the current working directory with
the name of zNNN.tab, where NNN is the z-number such as 092 for
uranium. When the fission channel is open, the fission level densities
for the first and second barriers will be red too.  These files are
zNNNmax1.tab and zNNNmax2.tab. For the data format, see RIPL technical
report.</p>


<h2><a name="groundstateomp">Use ground state OMP for excited states</a></h2>

<pre>
option   : groundstateomp
</pre>

<p>In a coupled-channels calculation, the optical potentials for the excited
states are often different from the one for the ground state when the potential
parameters are energy-dependent. This option forces to use the same optical
potential given for the ground state.


<h2><a name="continuumangdist">Calculate compound angular distribution for continuum</a></h2>

<pre>
option   : continuumangdist
</pre>


<p>Usually angular distributions of emitted particle from a compound
nucleus is isotropic when the final state is in the
continuum. However, there might be small anisotropy seen when the spin
distribution in the continuum is not so wide.  This option calculates
the angular distributions for such cases, although the output will be
much longer.</p>
