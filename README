CoH is a nuclear reaction calculation code, which includes the optical
model, the exciton preequilibrium model, the direct-semidirect model,
and the Hauser-Feshbach statistical model. It calculates nuclear
reaction cross sections for medium to heavy targets in the keV to MeV
energy region. The nuclear reaction cross sections include nucleon
elastic/inelastic scattering, capture, multi-nucleon evaporation, and
nuclear fission. Two mean-field models are also included: the Finite
Range Droplet Model (FRDM 1995) and the Hartree-Fock BCS model with
some Skyrme interactions.
