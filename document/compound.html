<h1><a name="compound">Precompound / Compound Reactions</a></h1>

<h2><a name="decay">Decay Channel Definition</a></h2>

<p>In the statistical model calculations for both compound and
precompound reactions, emitted particles can be controlled by giving
optical potential names in the <code>DATA</code> section. For
example,</p>
<pre>
BEGIN    :
DATA     :
...(snip)...
omp_n    : Koning
omp_p    : Perey
omp_a    : Avrigeanu
...(snip)...
ENDDATA  :
...(snip)...
END      :
</pre>
<p>means the composite system (incident + target) can emit neutrons,
protons, and alpha-particles, but no emissions of deuteron, triton,
nor helium-3. Once these particle emission channels are defined
by <code>omp_?</code> in the <code>DATA</code> section, the decay
channel transmission coefficients are calculated inside the code, and
the emission of these particles are automatically included as long as
excitation energy of the compound nucleus is larger than the
separation energy.</p>

<p>There are two data-definition keywords what for the compound
reactions in the <code>DATA</code> section, which are <code>bin</code>
and <code>partmax</code>.</p>
<pre>
BEGIN    :
DATA     :
...(snip)...
bin      : 0.2
partmax  : 1
...(snip)...
ENDDATA  :
...(snip)...
END      :
</pre>
<p><code>bin</code> is the energy width of continuum bins in
MeV. If <code>bin</code> is not given, CoH automatically determines
the energy width, depending on the incident energy. </p>

<p><code>partmax</code> is to control the maximum number of particle
emission. In the case of <code>partmax</code> = 1, the composite
system is allow to emit only one particle, so that there are (n,n'),
(n,p), (n,alpha) reactions, but no (n,2n). The <code>partmax</code> =
2 case includes (n,2n), (n,np), (n,2p), etc. This option is
particularly useful when particle incident energy is high, and you are
only interested in the reactions at the earlier stage. This option
truncates lengthy calculations of many particle emissions.<p>



<h2><a name="preeq">Exciton Model</a></h2>


<p>CoH includes the two-component exciton model for the preequilibrium
particle emissions. This model calculation is invoked when the input
file contains the top level keyword of <code>PREEQ</code>.

<pre>
BEGIN    :
DATA     :
incident : n
target   : Tc   99
energy   : 5.0
omp_n    : Koning
omp_p    : Koning
omp_a    : Avrigeanu
ENDDATA  :
PREEQ    :
ENDPREEQ :
HFS      :
ENDHFS   :
END      :
</pre>

<p>In the <code>PREEQ</code> section, there is no particular
data-definition keyword. However, strength of the preequilibrium
emission can be controlled in this section, by adjusting the averaged
two-body matrix elements. This adjustment can be made by a special
keyword <code>tweak</code>, which will be explained later.</p>


<h2><a name="fns">Prompt Fission Neutron Spectrum Model</a></h2>

<p>The prompt fission neutron energy spectra are calculated with the
Madland-Nix mode, when the top level keyword <code>FNS</code> is given.
This calculation invokes an exclusive particle emission spectrum
calculation too, hence this makes the whole calculation slower. It is
recommended that you should not use this model unless needed.</p>

<p>The data section looks like,</p>

<pre>
FNS      :
fragment :  Sr   96     Xe  140
energies :  186.98  171.8  -0.2  6.71  4.998
density  :  8.7273      12.7273    21.4545
density  :  8.7273      12.5       21.2
nuratio  : 1
maxwell  :  1.3240
rt       :  1.0
tpdf_s   :  1.2
anisotrop:  0.05
omp      :  Koning
ENDFNS   :
</pre>

<p> and there are seven data-fefinition kwywords.</p>

<p>A pair of representative fission fragments are given at
the <code>fragment</code> line, in the light Z, light A, heavy Z, and
heavy A order. If not given symmetric fission is assumed.</p>

<p>The keyword <code>energies</code> defines fission-related energies,
and four values are red - the total energy release, total kinetic
energy (TKE), energy-dependent term in TKE, average gamma-ray energy,
and average neutron separation energy. If each of them was zero, CoH
calculates them internally using approximated formulae.</p>

<p>The fragment effective level densities are given by
the <code>density</code> line. Three arguments are the level densities
for the light and heavy fragments, and the compound nucleus.  If not
given, CoH uses internal Fermi gas parameters. In this
case, <code>rt</code> controls the temperature ratio, Tl/Th.</p>

<p><code>nuratio</code> is the ratio of number of prompt fission
neutrons from the light fragment to that from the heavy fragment. This
will be a weight of fission neutron spectrum when the light and heavy
fragments are averaged.</p>

<p><code>tpdf_s</code> is a parameter for the temperature distribution
employed in the modified Madland-Nix model. If tpdf_s = 1.0, the
distribution is the same as the original triangular shape, namely a
linear functino from zero to Tmax. If this parameter is in between 1
and 2, another piece of triangle that drops from the top to zero is
added above Tmax.</p>

<p><code>anisotrop</code> is an anisotropy parameter often denoted by
a b-parameter, which modifies the average CMS spectrum in the
Madland-Nix model.</p>

<p>The calculated fission spectrum is printed as the ratio to the
Maxwellian, when the temperature <code>maxwell</code> is provided.</p>

<p>You can repeat <code>fragment, energies, density, rt</code>, and
<code> nuratio </code> several times. In this case, the first set of data
applies to the first chance fission, and the second set is used for
the second chance fission, etc. The total number of fission chance is
defined in constant.h, and the default value is 5.</p>



<h2><a name="hfs">Hauser-Feshbach Statistical Model</a></h2>

<p>The main Hauser-Feshbach model calculation is performed when the
top level keyword of <code>HFS</code> is defined. In this section, two
data-definition keywords control the calculations.</p>

<pre>
BEGIN    :
DATA     :
target   :    Ni 58
incident :    n
...
ENDDATA  :
HFS      :
levelcut :     Ni 59  10
levelcut :     Ni 58   5
photo    :     0.004
timecut  :    10.0
...
ENDHFS   :
END      :
</pre>

<p> CoH retrieves all the discrete level information (excitation
energy, spin, parity, gamma-ray branching ratio) from RIPL. However,
sometimes RIPL are too optimistic, and too many discrete levels are
given up to relatively high excitation energies in some cases.
The <code>levelcut</code> keyword, followed by the compound nucleus
name and a number <i>N</i>, forces the highest discrete level to
be <i>N</i>-th level.</p>


<p> In the RIPL discrete level database, two numbers for the highest
discrete levels are defined; NMAX to which the level scheme is assumed
to be complete but some spin or parity might be missing, and NC to
which all energy/spin/parity information is complete. CoH first reads
levels up to NMAX, then re-adjusts the highest level to which unique
spin and parity are given. If the number given
by <code>levelcut</code> is larger than this determined level, missing
spin and parity of the levels will be generated by a random number
according to the distributions of spin and parity.</p>

 
<p>In the <code>photo</code> line, an experimental gamma-ray strength
function &Gamma; /D<sub>0</sub> is given. CoH re-normalizes the
gamma-ray transmission coefficients to the given
value. When <code>photo</code> = -1, CoH adopts a system default
value. If <code>photo</code> < 0, but -1, the absolute of this value is
treated as the average &gamma; width, and D<sub>0</sub> internally
calculated is applied.</p>

<p>In many cases the gamma-ray strength function is not so sensitive
to the cross section calculation, except for the neutron capture and
the photo-induced reactions, and therefore default GDR parameters
built in the code work reasonably. When they become crucial or if you
want to add pygmy resonances, you can provide the GDR parameters in
the <code>gdr</code> line.

<pre>
HFS      :
gdr      : E1 11.4  2.59  323.4   GL
gdr      : E1 14.0  4.49  443.7   GL
gdr      : M1  6.0  4.0     1.0   SL
gdr      : E2 10.0  3.2     6.5   SL
ENDHFS   :
</pre>

<p>There are five parameters in each line: the GDR multipolarity
(should be E1, M1, or E2), the GDR energy and width in MeV, the peak
cross section in mb, and the Lorentzian shape (GL: generalized
Lorentzian, SL: standard Lorentzian, ML: modified Lorentzian).  The
Lorentzian shape can be omitted, then CoH assumes the first E1 (both
the single-hump and double-hump GDR) to be GL, and others will be
SL. </p>


<p>When comparing with experimental data, one may want to eliminate
gamma-ray lines produced by the isomeric states emerged in the
discrete gamma-ray transitions. This can be done by putting a
threshold time in the <code>timecut</code> line. If a half-life of the
state is longer than the given value, this transition is removed from
the calculation. In this case the total energy and reaction cross
section are not conserved because the gamma cascade produces isomeric
states.</p>


<h2><a name="fis">Fission Calculation</a></h2>

<p>A simple double/triple humped fission model, with the Hill-Wheeler
transmission calculation is implemented. The penetration probabilities
are calculated for the discrete and continuum transitions on top of
the fission barriers. The fission model parameters are the fission
barrier heights, curvatures, and moment of inertia.  The heights and
curvatures are required, while a default value of 5 keV is used if the
inertia parameter is not given.</p>

<p>For the discrete transition states, the band-head energies,
K-values, and parities are given.</p>

<p>The fission barrier parameters are given in the <code>HFS</code>
section.  The <code>barrier</code> keyword takes five parameters: Z
and A of fissioning nuclide, numeric character 0 or 1 or 2 to identify
the first, second, and the third barrier, fission barrier height,
curvature, and inertia in MeV.</p>

<p>The K-band parameters are given at the <code>kband</code> line,
followed by six parameters: Z, A, barrier identifier (0, 1, or 2), the
band-head energy, K, and parity (+1 or -1). The excitation energies of
J-pi states in each K-band are calculated by [(J(J+1)-K(K+1)]*inertia.
The <code>kband</code> line for a fission barrier must be given after
the corresponding <code>barrier</code> is defined. </p>

<pre>
HFS      :
barrier  :  Am  242  0  6.00   0.5

kband    :  Am  242  0  0.000   3.0    -1
kband    :  Am  242  0  0.025   2.0    -1

barrier  :  Am  242  1  5.50   0.40

kband    :  Am  242  1  0.000   3.0    -1
kband    :  Am  242  1  0.025   2.0    -1
ENDHFS   :
</pre>

<p>When the band parameters are provided, the boundary energy between
the continuum and the discrete levels is automatically determined.
This boundary energy can be changed by the 6-th data in
the <code>barrier</code> line.  This example cuts the discrete levels
at 300 keV.

<pre>
barrier  :  U  239  0  6.25   0.6  0.05  0.3
ENDHFS   :
</pre>
