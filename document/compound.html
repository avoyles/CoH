<h1><a name="compound">Precompound / Compound Reactions</a></h1>

<h2><a name="decay">Decay Channel Definition</a></h2>

<p>In the statistical model calculations for both compound and
precompound reactions, emitted particles can be controlled by giving
optical potential names in the <tt>DATA</tt> section. For example,</p>
<pre>
BEGIN    :
DATA     :
...(snip)...
omp_n    : Koning
omp_p    : Perey
omp_a    : Avrigeanu
...(snip)...
ENDDATA  :
...(snip)...
END      :
</pre>
<p>means the composite system (incident + target) can emit neutrons,
protons, and alpha-particles, but no emissions of deuteron, triton, nor
helium-3. Once these particle emission channels are defined
by <tt>omp_?</tt> in the <tt>DATA</tt> section, the decay channel
transmission coefficients are calculated inside the code, and the
emission of these particles are automatically included as long as
excitation energy of the compound nucleus is larger than the
separation energy.</p>

<p>There are two data-definition keywords what for the compound reactions
in the <tt>DATA</tt> section, which are <tt>bin</tt> and <tt>partmax</tt>.</p>
<pre>
BEGIN    :
DATA     :
...(snip)...
bin      : 0.2
partmax  : 1
...(snip)...
ENDDATA  :
...(snip)...
END      :
</pre>
<p><tt>bin</tt> is the energy width of continuum bins in MeV. If <tt>bin</tt>
is not given, CoH automatically determines the energy width, depending on
the incident energy. </p>

<p><tt>partmax</tt> is to control the maximum number of particle
emission. In the case of <tt>partmax</tt> = 1, the composite system is
allow to emit only one particle, so that there are (n,n'), (n,p),
(n,alpha) reactions, but no (n,2n). The <tt>partmax</tt> = 2 case
includes (n,2n), (n,np), (n,2p), etc. This option is particularly
useful when particle incident energy is high, and you are only
interested in the reactions at the earlier stage. This option
truncates lengthy calculations of many particle emissions.<p>



<h2><a name="preeq">Exciton Model</a></h2>


<p>CoH includes the two-component exciton model for the preequilibrium
particle emissions. This model calculation is invoked when the input
file contains the top level keyword of <tt>PREEQ</tt>. 

<pre>
BEGIN    :
DATA     :
incident : n
target   : Tc   99
energy   : 5.0
omp_n    : Koning
omp_p    : Koning
omp_a    : Avrigeanu
ENDDATA  :
PREEQ    :
ENDPREEQ :
HFS      :
ENDHFS   :
END      :
</pre>

<p>In the <tt>PREEQ</tt> section, there is no particular
data-definition keyword. However, strength of the preequilibrium
emission can be controlled in this section, by adjusting the averaged
two-body matrix elements. This adjustment can be made by a special
keyword <tt>tweak</tt>, which will be explained later.</p>


<h2><a name="fns">Prompt Fission Neutron Spectrum Model</a></h2>

<p>The prompt fission neutron energy spectra are calculated with the
Madland-Nix mode, when the top level keyword <tt>FNS</tt>is given.
This calculation invokes an exclusive particle emission spectrum
calculation too, hence this makes the whole calculation slower. It is
recommended that you should not use this model unless needed.</p>

<p>The data section looks like,</p>

<pre>
FNS      :
fragment :  Sr   96     Xe  140
energies :  186.98  171.8  -0.2  6.71  4.998
density  :  8.7273      12.7273    21.4545
density  :  8.7273      12.5       21.2
nuratio  : 1
maxwell  :  1.3240
rt       :  1.0
tpdf_s   :  1.2
anisotrop:  0.05
omp      :  Koning
ENDFNS   :
</pre>

<p> and there are seven data-fefinition kwywords.</p>

<p>A pair of representative fission fragments are given at
the <tt>fragment</tt> line, in the light Z, light A, heavy Z, and
heavy A order. If not given symmetric fission is assumed.</p>

<p>The keyword <tt>energies</tt> defines fission-related energies, and
four values are red - the total energy release, total kinetic energy
(TKE), energy-dependent term in TKE, average gamma-ray energy, and
average neutron separation energy. If each of them was zero, CoH
calculates them internally using approximated formulae.</p>

<p>The fragment effective level densities are given by
the <tt>density</tt> line. Three arguments are the level densities
for the light and heavy fragments, and the compound nucleus. 
If not given, CoH uses internal Fermi gas parameters. In this
case, <tt>rt</tt> controls the temperature ratio, Tl/Th.</p>

<p><tt>nuratio</tt> is the ratio of number of prompt fission neutrons
from the light fragment to that from the heavy fragment. This will be
a weight of fission neutron spectrum when the light and heavy
fragments are averaged.</p>

<p><tt>tpdf_s</tt> is a parameter for the temperature distribution
employed in the modified Madland-Nix model. If tpdf_s = 1.0,
the distribution is the same as the original triangular shape,
namely a linear functino from zero to Tmax. If this parameter
is in between 1 and 2, another piece of triangle that drops 
from the top to zero is added above Tmax.</p>

<p><tt>anisotrop</tt> is an anisotropy parameter often denoted by
a b-parameter, which modifies the average CMS spectrum in the
Madland-Nix model.</p>

<p>The calculated fission spectrum is printed as the ratio to 
the Maxwellian, when the temperature <tt>maxwell</tt> is provided.</p>

<p>You can repeat <tt>fragment, energies, density, rt</tt>, and
<tt> nuratio </tt> several times. In this case, the first set of data
applies to the first chance fission, and the second set is used for
the second chance fission, etc. The total number of fission chance is
defined in constant.h, and the default value is 5.</p>



<h2><a name="hfs">Hauser-Feshbach Statistical Model</a></h2>

<p>The main Hauser-Feshbach model calculation is performed when 
the top level keyword of <tt>HFS</tt> is defined. In this
section, two data-definition keywords control the calculations.</p>

<pre>
BEGIN    :
DATA     :
target   :    Ni 58
incident :    n
...
ENDDATA  :
HFS      :
levelcut :     Ni 59  10
levelcut :     Ni 58   5
photo    :     0.004
timecut  :    10.0
...
ENDHFS   :
END      :
</pre>

<p> CoH retrieves all the discrete level information (excitation
energy, spin, parity, gamma-ray branching ratio) from RIPL. However,
sometimes RIPL are too optimistic, and too many discrete levels are
given up to relatively high excitation energies in some cases.
The <tt>levelcut</tt> keyword, followed by the compound nucleus name
and a number <i>N</i>, forces the highest discrete level to
be <i>N</i>-th level.</p>


<p> In the RIPL discrete level database, two numbers for the highest
discrete levels are defined; NMAX to which the level scheme is assumed
to be complete but some spin or parity might be missing, and NC to
which all energy/spin/parity information is complete. CoH first reads
levels up to NMAX, then re-adjusts the highest level to which unique
spin and parity are given. If the number given by <tt>levelcut</tt> is
larger than this determined level, missing spin and parity of the
levels will be generated by a random number according to the
distributions of spin and parity.</p>

 
<p>In the <tt>photo</tt> line, an experimental gamma-ray strength function
&Gamma; /D<sub>0</sub> is given. CoH re-normalizes the gamma-ray transmission
coefficients to the given value. When <tt>photo</tt> = -1, CoH adopts a
system default value. If <tt>photo</tt><0, but -1, the absolute of 
this value is treated as the average &gamma; width, and D<sub>0</sub>
internally calculated is applied.</p>

<p>In many cases the gamma-ray strength function is not so sensitive
to the cross section calculation, except for the neutron capture and
the photo-induced reactions, and therefore default GDR parameters
built in the code work reasonably. When they become crucial or if you
want to add pygmy resonances, you can provide the GDR parameters in
the <tt>gdr</tt> line.

<pre>
HFS      :
gdr      : E1 11.4  2.59  323.4
gdr      : E1 14.0  4.49  443.7
gdr      : M1  6.0  4.0     1.0
gdr      : E2 10.0  3.2     6.5
ENDHFS   :
</pre>

<p>There are four parameters in theres lines: the GDR multipolarity
(should be E1, M1, or E2), the GDR energy and width in MeV, and the
peak cross section in mb.</p>


<p>When comparing with experimental data, one may want to eliminate
gamma-ray lines produced by the isomeric states emerged in the
discrete gamma-ray transitions. This can be done by putting a threshold
time in the <tt>timecut</tt> line. If a half-life of the state
is longer than the given value, this transition is removed from the 
calculation. In this case the total energy and reaction cross section
are not conserved because the gamma cascade produces isomeric states.</p>


<h2><a name="fis">Fission Calculation</a></h2>

<p>A simple double/triple humped fission model, with the Hill-Wheeler
transmission calculation is implemented. The penetration probabilities
are calculated for the discrete and continuum transitions on top of
the fission barriers. The fission model parameters are the
fission barrier heights, curvatures, and moment of inertia.
The heights and curvatures are required, while a default
value of 5 keV is used if the inertia parameter is not given.</p>

<p>For the discrete transition states, the band-head energies, K-values,
and parities are given.</p>

<p>The fission barrier parameters are given in the <tt>HFS</tt>
section.  The <tt>barrier</tt> keyword takes five parameters: Z and A of
fissioning nuclide, numeric character 0 or 1 or 2 to identify the
first, second, and the third barrier, fission barrier height,
curvature, and inertia in MeV.</p>

<p>The K-band parameters are given at the <tt>kband</tt> line,
followed by six parameters: Z, A, barrier identifier (0, 1, or 2), the
band-head energy, K, and parity (+1 or -1). The excitation energies of
J-pi states in each K-band are calculated by [(J(J+1)-K(K+1)]*inertia.
The <tt>kband</tt> line for a fission barrier must be given
after the corresponding <tt>barrier</tt> is defined. </p>

<pre>
HFS      :
barrier  :  Am  242  0  6.00   0.5

kband    :  Am  242  0  0.000   3.0    -1
kband    :  Am  242  0  0.025   2.0    -1

barrier  :  Am  242  1  5.50   0.40

kband    :  Am  242  1  0.000   3.0    -1
kband    :  Am  242  1  0.025   2.0    -1
ENDHFS   :
</pre>

<p>When the band parameters are provided, the boundary energy 
between the continuum and the discrete levels is automatically determined.
This boundary energy can be changed by the 6-th data in the <tt>barrier</tt> line.
This example cuts the discrete levels at 300 keV.

<pre>
barrier  :  U  239  0  6.25   0.6  0.05  0.3
ENDHFS   :
</pre>
