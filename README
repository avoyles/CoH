CoH is a code that includes the optical model, the preequilibrium
model, and the Hauser-Feshbach statistical model. It calculates
nuclear reaction cross sections for medium and heavy targets in the
keV and MeV energy region. The nuclear reaction cross sections include
nucleon elastic/inelastic scattering, capture, multi-nucleon
evaporation, and nuclear fission. Two mean-field models are also
included: the Finite Range Droplet Model (FRDM) and the Hartree-Fock
BCS model with the Skyrme interaction.
