<h1> Introduction </h1>
<h2><a name="general"> General Information </a></h2>

<p>CoH is an optical model, exciton preequilibrium, and
Hauser-Feshbach statistical model code, which calculates nuclear
reaction cross sections for medium to heavy targets in the keV to
MeV energy region. This program is written in standard C++, divided
into approximately 200 source and header files.</p>

<p>CoH solves the Schroedinger equation for optical potentials defined
in the code, and calculates differential elastic scattering, reaction,
and total cross sections, for neutron, proton, deuteron, triton, He3,
and alpha-particle. Deformed optical potentials are solved with the
coupled-channels method, in which the ground state rotational band
members, or vibrational phonon states are coupled.</p>

<p>The optical model gives particle transmission coefficients that are
fed into the statistical model calculations. CoH includes the
pre-equilibrium model (exciton model), the direct/semidirect capture
model, and the multi-stage Hauser-Feshbach statistical decay with
width fluctuation correction by Moldauer. For weakly coupled levels,
the DWBA method is used to calculate the direct inelastic scattering
process to the excited states.</p>

<p>CoH originally stood for a <span style="color:red;"> Compact
optical and Hauser-Feshbach models</span> as the code was relatively
compact and small memory usage.  As one can imagine, a compact code is
no longer compact after several years. Nowadays CoH stands for
nothing. It is just a name, like Coo.</p>


<h2><a name="history"> History </a></h2>

<p>The original code, written in C, first appeared in August 1992,
which was an optical and Hauser-Feshbach code for binary reactions,
run on an 16-bit MS-DOS PC. In June 1995 the code was totally
rewritten, including an optical potential parameter search option
using a generalized least-squares method (ver.2.0).</p>

<p> Ver.2 series had been slowly developed until ver.2.3, which
includes the neutron capture calculations and the coupled-channels
method for the deformed optical potential.</p>

<p>In 2008 holiday season, I decided to write a new Hauser-Feshbach
code, just like GNASH, based on CoH 2.3. Though about 50% of the
source program came from CoH 2.3, quite a few number of program
sources had been incorporated - those were the Direct/Semidirect model
code DSD, the Feshbach-Kerman-Koonin model code CmC, and the gamma-ray
cascading simulation code CGM. All these modules but for CGM were
originally in C, and they were converted into C++.</p>

<p>CoH ver.3 (CoH<sub>3</sub>) has a project name, taken from moons in
the solar system. This developing version - project
name <b>Ganymede</b> - was first finished in March 2009, and a test
distribution version <b>Callisto</b> was made in May 2009. Note that
there exist other two different versions, <b>Io</b> and <b>Europa</b>
that were named for the CGM code. This is because CoH ver.3.0 adopted
the same coding style as CGM though CoH<sub>3</sub> is an extended
version of v.2.3. </p>

<p>Starting in 2010, CGM and CoH<sub>3</sub> got a different
versioning method. Now CoH<sub>3</sub> has the names
after the moons of Uranus. Ver.3.1 was <b>Ariel</b>.</p>

<p>In 2012, an optional code, ECLIPSE, was merged into the main source.
This facilitates making ENDF-6 formatted files, including the exclusive
particle emission spectra, and double differential cross sections.
Outputs by CoH can be processed with the DeCE code to generate the
ENDF nuclear data files.</p>

<p>Ver.3.4 <b>Oberon</b>, released in 2015, got a significant upgrade
by including nuclear structure model calculations, namely Finite Range
Droplet Model (FRDM) and Hartree-Fock BCS (HF-BCS) Model. These
mean-field model calculations are performed prior to cross section
calculations. This release also provides a beta-delayed neutron and
gamma-ray emission calculation code BeoH. Ver. 3.5 <b>Miranda</b>
was released in 2015 too, in which the coupled-channels model part
was largely modified. This was done for both the phonon excitation,
and the rigorous treatment of the direct channel in the Hauser-Feshbach
formalism, so-called the Engelbrecht-Weidenmueller transformation.
</p>


<p>Although there was no significant changes but many small upgrades
at various places since <b>Miranda</b>, a new Ver.3.6 <b>Cordelia</b>
series started in 2024. The primal goal of this version is to release
CoH as open-source.</p>
